# 📚 DSA Practice – Complete Roadmap

Welcome to my *DSA-Practice* repository.  
This repository contains structured Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) topics for *interview preparation, problem-solving, and self-study*. Each folder includes theory, Python implementations, and a curated list of problems (easy → hard).  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap Overview

The topics are organized to *build skills progressively*, from foundational mathematics to advanced algorithms.

| Module | Topics | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 01 | Mathematics | ⬜ |
| 02 | Patterns | ⬜ |
| 03 | Time & Space Complexity | ⬜ |
| 04 | Arrays | ⬜ |
| 05 | Strings | ⬜ |
| 06 | Linked Lists | ⬜ |
| 07 | Stacks & Queues | ⬜ |
| 08 | Trees | ⬜ |
| 09 | Binary Search Trees (BST) | ⬜ |
| 10 | Heaps | ⬜ |
| 11 | Graphs | ⬜ |
| 12 | Hashing | ⬜ |
| 13 | Recursion & Backtracking | ⬜ |
| 14 | Dynamic Programming | ⬜ |
| 15 | Greedy | ⬜ |
| 16 | Searching & Sorting | ⬜ |
| 17 | Bit Manipulation | ⬜ |

## 🗂 Structure of Each Module

1. *Python Implementations* – Solutions to common problems.  
2. *README.md* – Concept summary, key algorithms, tips, and problem checklist.  
3. *Problem Difficulty* – Easy → Medium → Hard, marked as solved/unsolved.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build strong *problem-solving skills* in DSA.  
- Prepare for *coding interviews* (LeetCode, GFG, InterviewBit).  
- Understand *time & space complexity* of each algorithm.  
- Progress from *basic topics → advanced topics → optimization techniques*.
